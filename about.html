                <p>I was lucky enough to attend one of the best schools in the world (in my opinion). One of my favorite aspects of my high school was how acceptable they were of whatever you wanted to do after graduating. As long as you set a goal you wanted to achieve, you were doing something right with your future, no matter what it may be.</p>

                <p>I feel the biggest impact that my school had on me was the memories that will stay in my mind forever. I will never forget the time I spent with my peers and formed an incredible bond with them. I will never forget performing in any school function in front of parents. I will never forget the nights staying up until 3 a.m. just to be able to keep my grades up for success in the future. I will never forget the long hours we spent writing our projects during summer vacation. I will never forget the wait for games period, that one period, once a week was the only reason for full attendance on that day. All of these memories have shaped the person I am today, and I do not know what I would do without attending this particular school. I can’t imagine how I would have turned out if I had been in any other school.</p>

                <p>Hard work and success was something that was taught to me and was not easily learned. Within my school, I learned that I had to push myself to be able to obtain a perfect score in a test or an exam. I could not wing it and still obtain exceptional scores. My school has made such a positive impact on me that it has shaped me into a better person and now wherever I go, I spread that vibe. My school is incredibly lucky to be blessed with one of the greatest teachers. They do everything they can to try to get to know each and every student that they can and mentor them personally. By doing this, every single student at school feels welcome and that they have a purpose within. I feel incredibly blessed to have known and interacted with such positive and powerful individuals who truly want the best for each student.</p>

                <p>I truly, deeply thank my school for shaping me into the person I am today. Each and every experience has changed my life for the better, and without this particular school, I don’t think I would be as successful as I have become today. Thank you Stella Maris Inter College. Stay gold.</p>
