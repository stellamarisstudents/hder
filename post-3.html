                    <p>So, what exactly is a change? How is it related to intelligence? These were the first questions that struck me on reading this quote. In layman language, change is referred to as modification. If we think practically, without modifications we would not exist. Everyone in this world fights to survive and this survival rate is directly proportional to how well one can exist with the circumstances one is thrown in. To make things clearer let me give you a very simple example. A man drives every day to his office, as he approaches a red light he needs to slow his car down and eventually stop. What if he doesn’t? His car will crash and the accident could be fatal for him. As the man changes the speed of his car according to his requirements, similarly, we need to alter ourselves, our behavior, according to the situation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Often we have heard, ”Change is the only thing constant”. When you consider change is inevitable, it is clear that everyone must be proficient in navigating the situation and changing one’s attitude according to it or else the consequences become inevitable. It is impossible to escape change. When a person is unable to navigate in the waters of change, it invites problems and even disasters. No matter what level of formal education one has received, in this world of hardships only those with the ability to change are considered intelligent. Somebody with an IQ of 148 has some serious health problems but decides to ignore them and continue living the way he is. Can he escape death? No, eventually he will die because he decided on not modifying in the face of change i.e he decides to not seek treatment.</P>
                    
                    <p>To be successful one really needs to change. Have you seen a river? How meandering and winding its course is! Do you know why? Whenever any obstacle comes its way the river either cuts it to make a new course or goes around it. In the end, it finally reaches its destination- the sea. Similarly for a man to be successful, he must not stop his efforts. He must change his strategies and other traits according to his circumstances. It is wiser to go around the object than to be deterred by its formidable height. In life, you find three types of people: the pessimists who complain about the wind, the optimists who expect the wind to change, and the mature and realist who adjust the sails according to the wind.</p>
                    
                    <p>Why is it that elderly folks are considered as the most mature? It is because throughout their life they have been through many changes and have gained a lot of experience from these changes. Some wise old man once said, “To improve is to change. To be perfect is to change often.”</p>
                    
                    <p>One can compare life to an untitled book. What do you do when one chapter ends? Do you close the book and never read it again? No, you read the next chapter. We need to remember that it is just another chapter. There will be more chapters after it and finally, when you finish reading the last chapter, the title of the book will reveal itself to you—the life of (your name).</p>
