        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>We shout over rooftops that we are the world’s largest democracy and assume that it is also the best. Well, look again. Is the system truly representative? At the time of voting, people make choices based on their belief and understanding of the leader they choose and that leader, post being elected, represents the people, as their voice. That’s idealistic but is that true? Does the elected leader reflect what the people want or is it mostly about what that leader wants, often for his own reasons?</p>

                    <p>Look at the fact on the ground. The majority of the Indian people still live in rural India, in poverty and poor living conditions, and with little education or awareness of matters outside their areas of residence. Yet, 98% of the people who would fall in this category are responsible for choosing a government that will legislate over the future of the country.</p>

                    <blockquote>The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all.<br>-John F. Kennedy</blockquote>

                    <p>It is one man – one vote and that is all that matters. Well is it? Is the vast majority really capable of understanding and judging the leaders they choose? The lack of education and awareness, coupled with abject poverty, often forces the voters to elect leaders who seem to offer them solutions for a better life but instead end up buying or coercing them to vote. So do they really represent the people?</p>

                    <p>Isn’t it common to see votes being bought and sold in its crudest form? Don’t we see vote bank politics being practiced in its worst form, or votes being garnered based on caste or religion? What about votes garnered through threat or at gunpoint? It all happens and is part of Indian politics.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>A great democracy must be progressive or it will soon cease to be a great democracy.<br>-Theodore Roosevelt</blockquote>

                    <p>So can anyone stand up and claim the virtues of Indian democracy as being truly fair and truly representative? Should we really beat our chests with pride while proudly claiming to be the world’s oldest democracy?</p>

                    <p>Bihar has always been at the forefront of entertaining politics. But when the Chief Minister gets convicted of serious crime and he appoints his wife as his proxy with nonchalance, it is time to sit up and question the ‘quality’ of politics that we practice. It may be ‘Indian’ politics but it is wrong, very wrong.</p>
                    
                    <p>The list of misuse in politics is endless and the ‘quality’ of politics practiced, questionable. The intelligentsia and civil society are aware of the failings, as you and I are too, but the big question before us is – what are we doing about it?</p>

                    <p>So can one really say that Indian politics, at all levels, is truly free and fair? The voting process may be free and fair, at least in most cases, but the process of politics that goes into the run-up to elections, and thereafter, is what is questionable. And that’s what is wrong with Indian politics.</p>

                    <p>Questions, dissent, and debate are an essential part of politics and democracy. The ‘quality’ of democracy and politics is judged by the level of debate and dissent allowed, within the party and outside of it.</p>

                    <blockquote>A democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.<br>-Benjamin Franklin</blockquote>

                    <p>India is witnessing increasing levels of intolerance to the above and that is very visible in state and national politics. Older parties like the Congress and BJP have shown signs of intolerance, as have new age parties like AAP. All parties are guilty of quashing dissent in any form. What is a worrying trend is that several parties are resorting to violent means whenever questioned by the people or members of their parties. Even the media, which serves as a watchdog for the people, has not been spared.</p>

                    <p>Another problem with Indian politics is increasing rowdyism in parliament and state assemblies. On paper, it’s a forum for free and fair debate but in practice, only those with high decibel shouting and aggressive behavior get heard. What chance does a Manmohan Singh have against a loud and aggressive politician from another party? Yet, daily we have incessant shouting that passes off as debate. So is this fair on those who do not possess the requisite shouting ability? Is that supposed to be a pre-qualification? The voice of each representative in Parliament must have equal and fair weight and must be given equal opportunity to express his or her viewpoint. That’s easier said, as in practice, it is almost always to the contrary.</p>

                    <p>And now for the biggest problem of them all, influence and impact of money on Indian politics. Politics has degenerated into a business that has a lot of money, some legal but mostly unaccounted, being plowed into it by vested interests. It’s a global phenomenon but a big problem nevertheless. As long as unaccounted money makes its way into politics, it will never be free or fair. And we, as a nation, have to come together to try and figure out how to address this, if Indian democracy has to prosper on the bed of fair politics</p>

                    <blockquote>May we think of freedom, not as the right to do as we please, but as the opportunity to do what is right.</blockquote> 

                    <p>It is time for the people to raise their voice and question their leaders and political parties, and force them to change for the better. For we have one non-negotiable weapon, our vote. Isn’t that what democracy is all about?</p>
