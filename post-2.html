                    <p>Just as harsh and negative as this may sound, it is indeed true. Like one of those hard to swallow pills. You know it is true, you just keep denying its plausibility. We live in a world of shattered dreams and broken lives where the only source of consolation we can justify for ourselves is through saying thick quotes on failures, hardships, and life. But once in a while, we stumble upon a quote like this which forces us to contemplate our entire lives- with a floodlight on our failures. </p>

                    <p>Wilde died at the early age of 46 but succeeded in leaving a lifetime of works and thoughts for the masses to deliberate and cogitate on. This quote simply stands as an underrated instance of the wit, flamboyance, and underlined satire that flowed in him. As acclaimed for his acuity Wilde understood what this world truly is, behind the veils of what it pretends to be.</p>

                    <p>A mistake doesn't necessarily make an experience. A mistake is a mistake. We ought to stop just chalking it up and begin dwelling on its negative impact as well. We can only learn from a mistake after we admit the fact that we've made it. Sadly, in most cases, we mask it up under the pretext of "experience earned the hard way" and move on without deriving either meaning or message from it.</p>

                    <p>Satire or not, some mistakes are irrevocable, damaging, and can cause reverberations that upset the entire course of our lives. Mistakes happen. But mostly we fail to feel the impact of them, to use an analogy from our nervous system. There are times when we might have been aware of the mistake and simply chose to ignore it. Often these prove fatal for our existence. </p>

                    <p>Experience, on the other hand, is a question of instinct about life. Experience is something we learn from- hopefully, reduce future risk or enhance future gain -rather than merely 'experiencing it (going through it)'. When Will Rogers said," Some people learn by reading. Some people learn by watching. Sadly, some folks just won't learn until they've peed on an electric fence." he was underlining the necessity of knowing what needs to be experienced and what deserves to be called a moronic mistake. </p>

                    <blockquote>Calling our fatal mistakes experience results not only in the recession of the gravity of the matter but also induces a sense of triviality in us, about the future course of our action. </blockquote>

                    <p>Some mistakes can just not be correlated to experience. More often than not, life presents us with one shot opportunities and if we miss those, there is no coming back for a second hit; there is no need for the experience because what's lost is lost forever. As is aptly said by Heraclitus, </p>

                    <blockquote>"No man steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." </blockquote>
